# napari_widgets/ - CODE Directory (Legacy)

> **This is a CODE directory.** Legacy widget stubs being migrated to `napari_plugin/`.

## What This Is

Legacy widget location. Active widgets have been moved to `napari_plugin/`. This directory may contain stub re-exports for backward compatibility.

## Rules

1. **Do not add new widgets here.** All new widget code goes in `napari_plugin/`.
2. **Migration target**: Contents should be migrated to `napari_plugin/` and this directory eventually removed.
