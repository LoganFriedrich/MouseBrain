# SUSPICIOUS REGION BREAKDOWN (likely false positives)
Suspicious: cerebellar_cortex,,,48,,Cerebellar cortex - no spinal projections (only deep nuclei do)
Suspicious: white_matter,,,120,,White matter tracts - should contain no cell bodies
Suspicious: olfactory,,,15,,Olfactory system - no spinal projections
Suspicious: cortical_superficial,,,179,,Cortical layers 1-3 - no corticospinal neurons (L5/6 only)
Suspicious: other_unlikely,,,63,,Other regions unlikely to project to cervical cord
