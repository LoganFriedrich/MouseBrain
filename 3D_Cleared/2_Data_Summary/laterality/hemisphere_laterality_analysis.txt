INTERPRETATION: HEMISPHERE LATERALITY PATTERNS
================================================================================

Overall: 13 regions show R > L bias (ratio < 0.95), 10 show L > R bias (ratio > 1.05)

SURFACE-ADJACENT vs DEEP REGION COMPARISON:
------------------------------------------------------------

  Surface-adjacent regions with R > L bias (7):
    Hypothalamic Periventricular Zone        L/R = 0.711  (L=132, R=186)  d=-0.26 [small]
    Magnocellular Reticular Nucleus          L/R = 0.713  (L=367, R=514)  d=-1.55 [large]
    Periaqueductal Gray                      L/R = 0.750  (L=305, R=407)  d=-0.36 [small]
    Lateral Reticular Nuclei                 L/R = 0.760  (L=483, R=636)  d=-0.78 [medium]

  Deep regions with R > L bias (2):
    Raphe Nuclei                             L/R = 0.814  d=-1.06
    Midbrain Midline Nuclei                  L/R = 0.880  d=-0.93
  Deep regions near-symmetric or L > R (6):
    Solitariospinal Area                     L/R = 1.002  d=0.01
    Medullary Reticular Nuclei               L/R = 1.003  d=0.01
    Perihypoglossal Area                     L/R = 1.035  d=1.44
    Pontine Central Gray Area                L/R = 1.143  d=0.49
    Red Nucleus                              L/R = 1.234  d=0.60
    Cerebellospinal Nuclei                   L/R = 1.825  d=4.49

POTENTIAL MENINGEAL ARTIFACT:
------------------------------------------------------------
  The R > L bias is concentrated in surface-adjacent brainstem
  regions (ventral and lateral surfaces), while deep/midline
  structures are near-symmetric. This spatial pattern is consistent
  with residual meningeal tissue on the right brain surface causing
  false-positive cell detections that get atlas-assigned to the
  nearest legitimate brain region.

  WHAT THE CURRENT FILTER CATCHES:
    - Entire region types that shouldn't contain spinal-projecting
      neurons (cerebellar cortex, white matter, olfactory, cortical
      layers 1-3, hippocampus, basal ganglia)

  WHAT IT CANNOT CATCH:
    - Meningeal false positives that are spatially near legitimate
      brainstem regions. These get atlas-registered to the nearest
      brain region (e.g., GRN, IRN, MARN) and pass all filters.
    - The filter works by region IDENTITY, not spatial LOCATION
      (surface vs. deep within a region).

  POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS:
    1. Visual QC of right-hemisphere detections in napari, focusing
       on brain surface areas in brainstem
    2. Spatial analysis of per-cell coordinates from
       all_points_information.csv — check if right-hemisphere cells
       in surface-adjacent regions cluster near the brain boundary
    3. Compare meningeal removal quality across brains
